# JS-Code-Formatter
<b>Code colors like YDNJS (book)</b>
<br>
Used css and js: https://github.com/google/code-prettify -> README.md -> Setup -> Getting started -> Serving your own JS & CSS -> download (or use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/code-prettify/master/distrib/prettify-small.tgz">direct link</a>)
<br>
(On 2017/01/26 the library is inaccessible, so I push here saved copy ('google-code-prettify' folder).)
